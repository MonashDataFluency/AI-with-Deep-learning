# AI with Deep Learning

This content assumes:
- Basic math and calculus
- Basic Python programming skills
- [The Intro to Deep Learning and TensorFlow Course](https://github.com/MonashDataFluency/intro-to-deep-learning-and-tensorflow)

The course is split into two workshops, which are ideally placed on a Friday and a Monday. Students are assigned some homework to complete between the two workshops.

## Files:
### Part 1
- A powerpoint recapping deep learning principles
- A folder of PyTorch exercises for the students to complete in breakout rooms

### Homework
- A powerpoint detailing what Temerature Scaling is and the structure of the homework
- A folder containing the homework exercises
- A folder with the completed homework exercises (to be covered at the beginning of the second workshop)
- Note that students will need a working python environment to complete the homework

### Part 2
- A folder containing markdown slides covering Deep Learning with HPC
- A folder of examples to be covered alongide the slides
- Students will need HPC accounts to be able to complete these exercises
